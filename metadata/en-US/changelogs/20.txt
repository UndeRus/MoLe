 * NEW:
  - App shortcuts for starting the new transaction activity on Android 7.1+
  - Auto-filling of the accounts in the new transaction screen can be limitted to the transactions using accounts corresponding to a filter -- the filter is set in the profile details
 * IMPROVED:
  - Account list: Accounts with many commodities have their commodity list collapsed to avoid filling too much of the screen with one account
  - Account list: Viewing account's transactions migrated to a context menu
  - Transaction list: Back now returns to the accounts list when activated after viewing account's transactions
  - Profile details: deleting a profile requires confirmation
  - Enable animations when adding/removing rows in the new transaction screen
  - Better visual feedback when removing transaction details rows by side-swiping
  - New transactions are now sent via the JSON API if it is available
  - Better progress handling while downloading transactions via the JSON API
 * FIXED:
  - Transaction list: keep account name filter when the device is rotated
  - Avoid a restart upon app startup when the active profile uses a non-default colour theme
  - Account commodities no longer disappear after updating the data from the remote backend via the JSON API
  - Fix handling of missing parent accounts in the legacy parser
  - Removed a couple of memory leaks
